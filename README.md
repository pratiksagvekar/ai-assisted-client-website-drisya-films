# Drisya Films — Portfolio

Client-requested portfolio website built for a real media production studio (Drisya Films).
The project demonstrates AI-assisted workflows for UX decisions, content structuring, and rapid iteration under real-world constraints.


Premium, dark, multi-page portfolio built with Next.js App Router, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion. Focused on converting visitors into WhatsApp inquiries.
Built end-to-end by Pratik Sagvekar — handling requirements breakdown, UI architecture, AI-assisted ideation, frontend implementation, and deployment readiness.


## Tech
- Next.js (App Router)
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion

## AI-Assisted Workflow

AI tools were used as a co-pilot for:
- Content structuring and copy refinement
- UX and CTA placement decisions
- Pricing section framing for services
- Rapid iteration during development

All architectural decisions, implementation, debugging, and trade-offs were handled manually, with AI used strictly as an accelerator for reasoning and iteration.



## Commands
```
# install
npm i

# dev
npm run dev
```

## What This Project Demonstrates

- Translating client requirements into a production-ready website
- Using AI to accelerate thinking, not replace engineering
- Frontend development with business and conversion goals
- Version control, repo structuring, and deployment readiness


## WhatsApp CTA
All CTAs use a placeholder link. Update it in `lib/constants.ts`.

## Why This Matters
This project reflects how modern developers can responsibly integrate AI into real client workflows — balancing speed, quality, and business impact without compromising engineering judgment.
